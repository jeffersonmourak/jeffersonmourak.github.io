# Hey there! I'm Jefferson

A software engineer who has spent more time debugging than waiting for a pot of bai√£o de dois to simmer. With over 10 years of experience on this rollercoaster called software development, I've participated in projects of various sizes and complexities, from time management systems to real-time data processing infrastructure for millions of simultaneous players in games you've probably played.

But man cannot live by code alone, I'm a board game enthusiast, and a fan of Astronomy and Physics. Whenever I can, I'm reading something about these subjects, and when I'm not doing that, I'm writing something to make someone's life easier. One of my most recent projects is Voting Poker, a completely free application to facilitate story voting in Planning Poker sessions.

If you want to know more about me, or just have a chat, hit me up on the links above and let's talk.
